# OpenTTD Military Items NewGRF file

## About

Military Items provides military aircrafts from around the world. 
The set is not aimed at specific military operators or manufacturers,
but rather gives you a broad selection so that you can be your own 
company. To support that goal, the vehicles are in dual company colours.

## Usage and Parameters

The first aircraft is available from 1949. Build (small) airports to use
aircrafts.

By default military airplanes (especially fighters) can carry only limited types
of cargo.

By default each vehicle can be purchased in similar years like in real life.
The vehicle life corresponds to use by users anywhere in the world.

## Requests

If you like a particular vehicle to be added to the set, you can make a 
request for that. Post your request in the development topic at 	
TT-Forums.net (*WILL BE ADDED*) 
and preferrably also to the issue tracker at the github repository 
(https://github.com/adpro/openttd-military-grf/issues) such that the 
request is not lost.

To avoid disappointment, consider the following rules for requests:
- The manufacturer and model must not already be present in the set;
- If the manufacturer is present in the set, the model must fill a 
  regional or timeframe gap;
- Sufficient information must be available to draw and code the vehicle;
- The development team and author reserves the right to interpret these rules more 
  like guidelines.

## Translations

There are only one way how to add new translation - add pull request to github repository.
