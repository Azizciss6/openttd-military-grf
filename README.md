# OpenTTD Military Items NewGRF file

## About

Military Items provides military aircraft from around the world, airports and other military stuff. 
The set is not aimed at specific military operators or manufacturers,
but rather gives you a broad selection so that you can be your own 
company. To support that goal, the vehicles are in dual company colours.

## Usage and Parameters

The first aircraft is available from 1913. Build (small) airports to use
aircraft.

By default military airplanes (especially fighters) can carry only limited types
of cargo. But this set also consists of heavy-lift military transport aircraft.

By default each vehicle can be purchased in similar years like in real life.
The vehicle life corresponds to use by users anywhere in the world.

The first airport is available from 1941. Build carrier-like airport to simulate aircraft carrier and to use naval aircraft.

### Parameters
The set provides parameters:

- Enable aircraft ranges
  - Limits the range of aircraft. Range is set similar to World Airliners Set. Default *Limited Aircraft range*.
- Disable date restrictions for airports
  - Make possibility to purchase airports without date limitations. Default *False*.


### Contents

The set contains several airports based on aircraft carriers. Due to the limitations of the game, these airports are adapted, ie. the bridge is on the opposite side, the airport is wider than an aircraft carrier, etc.

Normal airports are also available.

All airports are only available in north heading.

## Requests

If you like a particular vehicle to be added to the set, you can make a 
request for that. Post your request in the development topic at 	
TT-Forums.net (https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=88858) 
and preferably also to the issue tracker at the github repository 
(https://github.com/adpro/openttd-military-grf/issues) such that the 
request is not lost.

To avoid disappointment, consider the following rules for requests:
- The manufacturer and model must not already be present in the set;
- If the manufacturer is present in the set, the model must fill a 
  regional or time frame gap;
- Sufficient information must be available to draw and code the vehicle;
- The development team and author reserves the right to interpret these rules more 
  like guidelines.

## Translations
